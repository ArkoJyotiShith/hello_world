/*In a garden, there are several apples trees planted in a grid format. Each point (i,j) in the grid has |i| + |j| apples.

Allie can buy a square plot centred at (0,0). Find the minimum perimeter of the plot (1 unit having length = 1) such that she can collect at
least X apples. All plants on the perimeter of the plot are also included.

Sample:


Input = 1 Output = 8
input = 11 Output = 8
Input = 13 Output = 16
